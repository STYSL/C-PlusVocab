//Program: C-Plus Key Term Checker
//Author: F.RUSTIQUE JR
/* This program will prompt a user to enter the correct,
matching key word term taken from the course book with its given definition.
The definition will be displayed, one at a time, to the user as a question. 
The user will be able to quit the program at anytime by entering 'q' */

//THIS IS PSEUDOCODE = NON-WORKING PROGRAM:

//Begin header w/ necessary preprocessor directives, maybe more?:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib> //include for random function rand()
#include <map> //use to store questions and matching answers?

//Use the std namespace:
using namespace std;

//Begin body with main function:
int main(){   
    string input; //Declare a string "input" variable to store prompt responses from user:
    string question; //Declare a string "question" variable to store questions pulled from a map(?)

    //Declare/create a "keyTermQuestions" identifier that will be a kind of Python dictionary of key-value pairs.
    map<string, string> keyTermQuestions;
    
        //The key-value pairs will be the key term description as a question matched with the correct key term.
        // * Will need to know how to create this in C++, possibly as a "map"?:
        //Source for how to:  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/c-plus-plus-map-explained-with-examples/
        //Also use course book...
    
    //While loop will keep prompting user until either 'y' or 'q' is entered for "input":
    input = "null"; //input initialized to "null" to enter while loop:
    while (input != "y" || input != "q")
        //Within while loop, greet and prompt user to begin quiz or quit with 'y' or 'q':
        cout << "Hello. This is the Key Term Checker. Enter 'y' to begin or 'q' to quit: " << endl;
